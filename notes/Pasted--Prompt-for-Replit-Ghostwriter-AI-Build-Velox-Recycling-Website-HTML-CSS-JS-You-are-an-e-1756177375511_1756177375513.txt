# Prompt for Replit (Ghostwriter / AI) — Build Velox Recycling Website (HTML/CSS/JS)

You are an expert front‑end engineer and brand copywriter. Create a **fast, accessible, responsive website** for **Velox** — a company that **recycles plastic bottles into polyester thread** used to make products like **pillows** and other soft goods. The site should be built with **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** (no frameworks) and include production‑quality code, comments, and placeholder assets.

## 1) Project scope

* Multi‑page static site with a clean, modern eco‑friendly design.
* Emphasize the **bottle → flake → pellet → fiber → yarn → product** process.
* Showcase products (e.g., pillows, cushion inserts, fiberfill) and B2B services (fiber supply, OEM partnerships).
* Educate visitors about sustainability impact (waste diverted, CO₂ savings, water saved).
* Drive leads via **Contact** and **Request a Quote** forms.

## 2) Site map & pages

Create these pages with navigation + footer on every page:

1. **Home** (`index.html`)
2. **Process** (`process.html`) — end‑to‑end recycling workflow
3. **Products** (`products.html`) — pillows and other fiber‑based goods
4. **Impact** (`impact.html`) — real‑time counters & sustainability metrics
5. **About** (`about.html`) — mission, certifications, team
6. **Careers** (`careers.html`) — open roles, culture
7. **FAQ** (`faq.html`) — common questions
8. **Blog/News** (`blog.html`) — simple listing with article template `post.html`
9. **Contact** (`contact.html`) — contact details and forms

Include a **404 page** (`404.html`) and core utility pages (`privacy.html`, `terms.html`).

## 4) Visual design & brand guidelines

* **Palette:** deep green `#0B6B53`, leaf green `#1FA37A`, teal `#1CA8A8`, charcoal `#2B2B2B`, off‑white `#F7FBF9`, warm gray `#E8EEE9`.
* **Typography:** system‑font stack for performance; create CSS utility classes for headings, subheads, body, small.
* **Style:** airy layout, generous white space, rounded corners, soft shadows, subtle gradients, thin dividers.
* **Imagery:** use royalty‑free placeholders for bottles, flakes, fiber, spools, factory.
* **Icons:** inline SVG icons for sustainability stats (leaf, water droplet, CO₂, bottle, factory, thread spool, pillow).

---

## 5) Components (build as reusable HTML snippets + CSS + JS)

* **Header & Nav:** sticky, mobile‑first, hamburger menu; current page highlighted.
* **Hero section:** strong headline, subcopy, primary CTA (Request a quote), secondary CTA (See our process); background SVG wave.
* **Process timeline:** 6‑step horizontal/vertical responsive timeline (bottle → thread) with icons and short copy.
* **Lifecycle diagram:** accessible SVG diagram that can be keyboard‑navigated; tooltip on focus/hover.
* **Stats counters:** animated counters (IntersectionObserver) showing bottles diverted, CO₂ saved, water saved.
* **Product cards:** image, short spec, recycled content %, CTA.
* **Testimonials carousel:** simple, accessible carousel with pause/play and swipe support.
* **Logos strip:** partner/customer logos grid with grayscale → color hover.
* **Impact badges:** certifications (e.g., GRS, ISO 9001) as placeholders.
* **FAQ accordion:** keyboard‑accessible (ARIA) details/summary or custom accordion.
* **Contact form:** name, email, company, quantity/volume, message; basic client‑side validation.
* **Quote modal:** open from any CTA; same fields as contact + product interest dropdown.
* **Footer:** contact info, socials, quick links, newsletter signup.
* **Alert/Toast:** form success/error feedback.
* **Back‑to‑top button** and **scroll‑progress bar**.

## 6) Copy & messaging (generate readable placeholder text)

Adopt a confident, straightforward tone. Use this sample messaging (expand as needed):

* **Tagline:** “Turning bottles into better sleep.”
* **Mission:** “Velox transforms post‑consumer plastic bottles into high‑quality polyester thread and fiberfill, powering sustainable pillows and soft goods.”
* **Value props:**

  * Closed‑loop recycling at scale
  * Consistent fiber quality for bedding manufacturers
  * Verified recycled content and traceability
  * Lower carbon footprint vs. virgin polyester
* **Process blurbs (one‑liners per step):**

  1. Collection — “We source sorted PET bottles from certified partners.”
  2. Cleaning — “Bottles are washed, labels removed, and flakes created.”
  3. Pelletizing — “Purified flakes are melted into uniform PET pellets.”
  4. Extrusion — “Pellets are extruded into continuous filament fiber.”
  5. Texturizing — “Fibers are drawn, crimped, and spun into durable thread.”
  6. Products — “Thread and fiberfill become pillows and more.”
* **Impact copy examples:** “Every pillow keeps \~30 bottles out of landfills.” (use as a placeholder; show how to change the value in code.)

---

## 7) Interactivity & behavior

* Use **IntersectionObserver** for reveal‑on‑scroll animations (reduce‑motion respected).
* **Counters:** count up when visible; values editable in `counters.js`.
* **Carousel/Slider:** pure JS, no dependencies.
* **Sticky header** that shrinks on scroll.
* **Mobile menu** with focus trap and ESC to close.
* **Form validation:** HTML5 + custom messages; prevent submission without required fields; fake async submit with success/error toasts.
* **Simple site search** (client‑side) that filters FAQ and blog items.
* **Dark‑mode toggle** (prefers‑color‑scheme with manual override; remember in localStorage).

---

## 8) Accessibility

* Conform to **WCAG 2.2 AA** where feasible.
* Semantic HTML, proper landmarks, heading order.
* Label all form controls; visible focus states.
* Sufficient color contrast; respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
* Keyboard support for menus, accordions, carousels, modal.
* Alt text for images; `aria-live` regions for toasts.

---

## 9) Performance & SEO

* Lightweight, no external libraries.
* Preload key fonts (if any) and hero images; lazy‑load non‑critical images.
* Minify CSS/JS via simple build script comments (or provide minified versions alongside source).
* Add **meta tags** (title, description), **Open Graph**, **Twitter Cards**.
* Add **JSON‑LD structured data**: `Organization`, `Product`, and `FAQPage` where applicable.
* Provide `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`.

## 10) Content blocks per page (minimum)

**Home:** hero, process teaser, product highlights, impact counters, testimonials, logos, CTA.
**Process:** timeline + lifecycle SVG, gallery of each step, downloadable one‑pager (placeholder link).
**Products:** filterable grid (pillows, fiberfill, yarn), each card with specs (denier, cut length, recycled %), badging, and CTA.
**Impact:** live counters, methodology notes, certificates section, case study feature card.
**About:** mission, story, leadership (3–6 profiles), facility photos, certifications.
**Careers:** simple job board (client‑side JSON), benefits list, DEI statement.

## 11) Example data (use/editable JSON in `/js/` or inline `<script type="application/json">`)

* `products.json` with 6–12 items (name, category, image, recycledPct, specs, sku).
* `jobs.json` with 3–6 roles (title, location, description, applyEmail).
* `testimonials.json` with 3–5 quotes.

## 13) Deliverables

* All HTML pages and assets per the file tree.
* Clean, commented **CSS** split into `reset.css`, `styles.css`, `utilities.css`.
* Modular **JS** in files listed above.
* At least 5 inline SVG icons and 2 illustrative SVGs (hero wave + lifecycle).

* Simple lightbox for gallery images.
* Cookie‑less analytics placeholder (instructions only).
* Basic unit tests for utility JS (very small).

---

## 15) Brand variables (make easy to tweak)

Provide CSS variables in `:root` for colors, spacing scale, radius, shadow, and transitions, e.g.:

```css
:root{
  --color-primary:#0B6B53;
  --color-accent:#1FA37A;
  --color-teal:#1CA8A8;
  --color-ink:#2B2B2B;
  --color-bg:#F7FBF9;
  --radius:14px;
  --shadow:0 6px 24px rgba(0,0,0,.08);
  --space-1:4px; --space-2:8px; --space-3:12px; --space-4:16px; --space-5:24px; --space-6:32px;
}
```

---

## 16) Quality bar

* Validate HTML; avoid duplicate IDs.
* No console errors; graceful JS failures.
* Lighthouse targets: Perf > 90, A11y > 95, SEO > 90 on desktop.

---

## 17) What to output now

Output the full project as files in the specified tree, including commented code and sample copy/images (placeholders). If file streaming isn’t supported, concatenate files with clear `==== FILE: path ====` separators so I can split them.
